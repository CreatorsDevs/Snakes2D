# Snake2D Multiplayer Game

Welcome to the Snake2D Multiplayer Game! This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game that we used to play on old Nokia phones. While the original game was simple, it had an undeniable charm and addictive gameplay. In this project, I have leveraged the engaging nature of the game and added exciting new features.

## Overview

The Snake2D Multiplayer Game retains the familiar mechanics of the old Snake game but introduces a multiplayer environment, allowing you to challenge your friends. The objective remains the same - guide your snake to eat as many apples as possible and grow longer without colliding with the boundaries or your opponent's snake.

## Features

- **Interactive Lobby UI:** The game features an intuitive lobby UI that allows players to set up and configure their multiplayer matches easily. You can invite a friend to join you for a thrilling multiplayer showdown.

- **2-Player Mode:** Engage in head-to-head matches against your friends in the multiplayer mode. Compete to see who can achieve the highest score and the longest snake.

- **Power-Ups:** Spice up the gameplay with power-ups that appear at random intervals. Power-ups include 2x Speed, 2x Score, and Shield. Strategically collect and utilize them to gain an advantage over your opponent.

- **Sleek User Interface:** The game incorporates a sleek user interface that effectively displays the acquired power-ups. It enhances the visual experience and keeps you informed about your current power-up status.

- **Pause Menu:** Enjoy the convenience of an on-demand pause menu accessible through the Escape key. Pause the game whenever you need a break or want to adjust the settings.

- **Audio Immersion:** Elevate your gaming experience with background music and immersive sound effects. The carefully chosen audio elements add depth and engagement to the gameplay.
